# How to use Bulma in a Vue3 project (not using Buefy)

For a Vue3 project created with the Vue CLI (With the CSS Pre-processors not selected)

https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/

Omit the first step, since we are using the already available project structure with it's package.json

Then install the packages for development, as we are only customizing bulma during development time

    npm install node-sass --save-dev
    npm install bulma --save-dev    
    
This will add the packages to the `devDependencies` in `package.json`
